We strictly do not store any data unless the user willingly agrees (also known as "register" and completing the "Registration") to do so by executing the command named **/start** or by [inviting the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=780817258494689281&permissions=379968&scope=bot) to a Discord server. Actions and interactions with the bot performed prior to the execution of the command do not get stored. We explicitly do not store any data that can lead to the identification of an individual outside of Discord.

### What data do we collect?

In order to provide full bot functionality, we need to collect and use information from our users.

The information we collect includes:

- User provided settings such as reminders.
- Individual user progression (virtual user money, upgrades and more).
- Logs (virtual money transactions, votes, errors including data about who caused these and more).
- Statistics data (executed commands, bot popularity related growth).

Any data we collect is not shared with third parties and stored securely in a protected database.

### How do we use this data?

We may use your Discord username and discriminator to display these in in-game leaderboards and other features or the Bot that can be accessed by all users who have access to it, ergo users who have registered with the game. 

### Who has access to this data?

- All individual user progression data is publicly available and can be accessed by any registered user.
- Logs and statistics data can be accessed by Mining Tycoon Admins ("Bot Managers") and Developers.

### For how long do we store data?
